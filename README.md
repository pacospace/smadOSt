# This paper introduces Space Mission Analysis and Design Open Source Tool  (smadOSt).  This  tool  is  completely  open  source and  available  to users  interested  in learning  how  SMAD  project  works.   All  the  models  are  implemented using Python. This tool will support the preliminary analysis required for the design of a space mission. The tool will be provided with:  Payload tool, Mission Analysis tool  and  Subsystems  design  tools  (C&DH, TMTC, AOCS, EPS, TCS, Cost, Structure,  Configuration and  Operations). It will be based on the Concurrent engineering Approach used in a Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) for the design of a space mission.
# The requirements stated for the development of the tool are:
#•DYNAMIC, it can evolve during the design because new data can be provided for better accuracy of the results;
#•MODULAR, it is possible to select the models to adopt;
#•FAST, it can reduce the time to obtain results and specific analysis;
#•TRACEABLE,  each  analysis  is  stored  with  all  the  results  obtained;
#•USER-FRIENDLY, it has few inputs for the User and a Simple and Interactive GUI;
#•FLEXIBLE, it can be adopted in different phases of the mission design and for class of satellites.
