### This paper introduces Space Mission Analysis and Design Open Source Tool (smadOSt). 

### This tool is completely open source and available to users interested in learning how SMAD project  works. The tool is developed using Python. 

### This tool will support the preliminary analysis required for the design of a space mission. It will be provided with: Payload tool, Mission Analysis tool and Subsystems design tools (C&DH, TMTC, AOCS, EPS, TCS, Cost, Structure, Configuration). It will be based on the Concurrent engineering Approach used in a Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) for the design of a space mission.

#### The requirements stated for the development of the tool are:
<p>1.DYNAMIC, it can evolve during the design because new data can be provided for better accuracy of the results;
<p>2.MODULAR, it is possible to select the models to adopt;
<p>3.FAST, it can reduce the time to obtain results and specific analysis;
<p>4.TRACEABLE, each analysis is stored with all the results obtained;
<p>5.USER-FRIENDLY, it has few inputs for the User and a Simple and Interactive GUI;
<p>6.FLEXIBLE, it can be adopted in different phases of the mission design and for different class of satellites.
